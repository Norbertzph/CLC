Reminders is an online exhibition about Chinese Labour corps, which was a force of workers recruited by the British and France government inÂ World War I. Visitors have to complete three crossword puzzles to drag random words on the web page into sentences to complete the whole sentence. All three sentences are negative racist comments about the Chinese Labour corps. After completing the three, visitors will receive a positive comment from a newspaper at the time about the contribution of the Chinese Labour corps. Finally, visitors will enter a page, which is about the Chinese cemetery of the British Army at noyelles-sur-mer and Gravestone in noyelles-sur-mer. By this online exhibition, visitors can explore this history and this people by themselves. Through the understanding of different comments on the same historical event, visitors can have a deeper understanding and reflection of racism, historical truth and collective memory.
